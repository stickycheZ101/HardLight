# Example: How to manually create a docking arm destination
# This approach does NOT require a DockingArmGenerator component on the station

# Step 1: Create a destination map file (e.g., Maps/Misc/docking_arm_dest.yml)
# with a small grid containing a Gateway entity

# Step 2: Load that map and add DockingArmDestinationComponent to it

# Here's an example you can paste directly into your main map file:

# entities:
# - uid: 1000  # Your main station
#   type: BaseStation
#   components:
#   - type: Transform
#     pos: 0,0
#
# - uid: 2000  # Docking arm destination map
#   type: entity
#   components:
#   - type: Map
#   - type: MapGrid
#   - type: DockingArmDestination
#     gridPath: /Maps/Structures/my_docking_arm.yml  # Path to the actual docking arm structure
#     locked: false  # Set to false so it's immediately available
#     loaded: false  # Will become true after first spawn
#   - type: Transform
#
# - uid: 2001  # Gateway on the destination map
#   type: Gateway
#   components:
#   - type: Transform
#     parent: 2000  # Parent to the destination map
#     pos: 0,0
#   - type: Gateway
#     name: "Docking Arm Alpha"
#     enabled: true

# IMPORTANT: You also need to create the actual docking arm grid file at the gridPath location
